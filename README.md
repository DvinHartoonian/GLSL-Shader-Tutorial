# GLSL-Shader-Tutorial

A personal project with a basic set of self taught shader code written in GLSL. This code is packaged as a "shaderpack" and is designed to be used with the shaders mod for Minecraft.
This folder is to be placed in the "shaderpacks" folder located in the root directory of a Minecraft installation.
This "shaderpack" requires either the "Optifine" or the Shaders mod to be installed for Minecraft.

This "shaderpack" features basic tonemapping and vignettes.
